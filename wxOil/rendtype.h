>	Comment:	RenderType

	Author:		Andy_Pennell (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	9/11/93
	Purpose:	A enumerated type to help in rendering to different devices. Some types
				are Kernel-safe (i.e. will exist on all platforms), others are specific
				to a particular OIL implementation. Examples are RENDERTYPE_SCREEN, _PRINTER,
				_METAFILE etc.
			
********************************************************************************************/

enum RenderType
{
	RENDERTYPE_NONE,							// these are Kernel-types
	RENDERTYPE_SCREEN,
	RENDERTYPE_PRINTER,
	RENDERTYPE_PRINTER_PS,
	RENDERTYPE_MONOBITMAP,						// Deprecated - HITDETECT used instead now
	RENDERTYPE_COLOURBITMAP,
	RENDERTYPE_SCREENXOR,						// used to XOR to the screen
	RENDERTYPE_SCREENPAPER,						// (not currently used)
	RENDERTYPE_FILE,
	RENDERTYPE_HITDETECT,						// 32BPP hit detection based on transparency

	RENDERTYPE_METAFILE16 = 0x80,				// these are OIL-specific types
	RENDERTYPE_METAFILE32
