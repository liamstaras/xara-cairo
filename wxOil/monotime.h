>	class MonotonicTime

	Author:		Phil_Martin (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	8/7/1993
	Base Class:	None
	Friends:	None
	Purpose:

	This class stores samples of the ever-increasing system ticker (the "monotonic clock" in
	Archy speak) and stores them. The samples can then be manipulated by member functions.

	Where times are passed in and out of these functions they are always given in
	milliseconds.
