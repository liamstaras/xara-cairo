// OIL specific Module support routines supplied for the Kernel

/********************************************************************************************

>	class OILModule

	Author:		Tim_Browse (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	30/6/93
	Purpose:	This class hides the mechanism of loading modules via whatever OS calls
				are required.  For example, under Windows it loads DLLs and interrogates
				them, whereas on the Arc something quite different could happen.
				It also provides a link between a kernel 'Module' item and the OIL
				transport mechanism used to load it.
