	// [A quick story from richard]
	// Whilst writing the library gallery code I came to much grief using MFC functions
	// to check for a file's existance and its size... In the end I resorted to writing
	// some functions of my own which did the same job, only better, and didn't hinder
	// timings that much. The above code was found to have problems with certain files.
	// Basically if the file has invalid datestamps, MFC goes tits-up... We found quite
	// a few files in this catagory... The below call is known to work, and has been
	// tested beyond belief whilst writing gallery stuff...

	// just get on and do the needed conversion as efficiently as possible
