/********************************************************************************************

>	class EPSCommentDef

	Author:		Graeme_Sutherland (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com> (from Tim's code)
	Created:	27/4/00
	Purpose:	Describes an EPS/DSC comment, and describes how to handle it.
				There are four fields:

				StartMarker - a string which is the start of the comment block, 
							  e.g. "%%BeginSetup"

				EndMarker   - a string which is the end of the comment block,
							  e.g. "%%EndSetup"

				ProcessContents - a boolean; if TRUE, all comments found within the
								  comment block should be passed around to the document
								  components for processing as usual.
								  If FALSE, then all lines in the comment block should
								  be completely ignored.

				Nesting		- the current nesting level of this comment - this is set up
							  to be 0 before loading a new file, and means we can cope
							  with, e.g. nested documents correctly.
