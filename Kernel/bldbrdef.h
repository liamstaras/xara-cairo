	Author:		Diccon_Yamanaka (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	13/12/99

	Purpose:	Stores a vector Brush definition created by blending two other brush definitions.
				Unlike regular brush definitions these are not stored in the brush component, 
				instead they are attached to a BlendPathProcessorBrush for the purposes of rendering
				and are then destroyed
				They are also created differently, rather than passing in a subtree of nodes
				instead they are given already blended blendpaths and attribute maps.

	SeeAlso:	BrushDefinition (brshcomp.h/.cpp)
