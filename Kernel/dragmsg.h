/*********************************************************************************************

>	class DragMessage : public Msg

	Author:		Jason_Williams (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	2/1/95
	Purpose:	This message is sent to inform the system of important global drag events.
				Currently the only such event is DRAGSTARTING, sent whenever a global drag
				is started by calling DragManagerOp::StartDrag. It informs all interested
				parties that they should register DragTarget objects with the drag manager
				to handle the drag.

	Notes:		The IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC can be found in kernel\draginfo.cpp

	SeeAlso:	DragManagerOp::StartDrag; DragTarget

	Documentation:	Docs\Specs\DragMan.doc
