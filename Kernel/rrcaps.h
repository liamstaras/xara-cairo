>	class RRCaps : public CC_CLASS_MEMDUMP

	Author:		Rik_Heywood (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	10/4/95
	Purpose:	This class has been designed to hold all the different things that a render
				region may or may not be able to render. eg. Some render regions can render
				transparency, while others can not. This class is used to record what your
				render region can do. It does this by having a flag for all the area of
				rendering that some regions can do and other can not. By default this
				class assumes that you can do nothing, so it is up to you to set the flags
				for the things you can do to TRUE. TRUE means you can render that type of
				thing, FALSE means that you can not. The flags to date are :-

						BOOL Transparency;
						BOOL GradFills;
						BOOL PerspectiveGradFills;
						BOOL BitmapFills;
						BOOL PerspectiveBitmapFills;
						BOOL LineAttrs;
						BOOL ArrowHeads;
						BOOL DashPatterns;
