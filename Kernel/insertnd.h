// InsertNode - a node which indicates the current insertion position in each document


/********************************************************************
>	class InsertionNode : public Node

Created:	04/07/94
Author:		Simon_Maneggio (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
Purpose:	The insertion node is used to locate the position in the 
			tree where new objects are inserted. A pointer to the 
			insertion node is stored in the Document object.

			There will be only one instance of an InsertionNode in 
			each camelot document. It will live as a last child of 
			the the selected spread's active layer.
