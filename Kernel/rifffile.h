>	class RIFFFile : public CC_CLASS_MEMDUMP

	Author:		Ben_Summers (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>	
	Created:	21 03 95	
	Purpose:	Nice class for reading RIFF files, takes a CCFile in the Init() routine
				to get it's data from.
				This doesn't view a RIFF file quite how they're actually stored on the disc.
				It's viewed as a series of Objects. These objects can be
					Chunks
					Start of lists
					End of lists
					End of file
				An object inside a list has a higher level than the list and chunks just
				before the list.
				You ask for the next object with NextObject(). This reads in the details
				about the next object in the file, which you can then read with the Get
				functions.
				You can get at the data with GetChunkData - this will error if the last
				object is not a chunk. This function reads the data into a block you give it.
				Alternatively, use AquireChunkData which will read it into a block maintained
				by this class.
				Data is not read unless it has to be.
				RepeatCurrent() will repeat the current object, giving one level of rewind.
				Useful for reading files with naff structures.
				SkipToListEnd() will skip to the end of the list of the level given.
				
				It's recommended that you have a quite shufty at the documentation in the
				MSDN about RIFF files.
