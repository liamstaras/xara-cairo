/**************************************************************************************

>	typedef enum FlatteningFactor

	Author:		Graham_Walmsley (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	9/4/97
	Purpose:	Use in conjunction with Path::Flatten.

				Instead of passing a double to Path::Flatten, you can pass
				a FlatteningFactor. Passing FF_VERYCLOSELY will flatten the paths
				a lot, passing FF_APPROXIMATELY will flatten them less, etc.

				This is used in Imagemaps, in which it's useful to have
				four discrete levels of flattening.

				Feel free to add intermediate levels of flattening (e.g. add
				"FF_XXXXCLOSELY = 32") but don't change the values
				assigned to FF_VERYCLOSELY, FF_CLOSELY, FF_APPROXIMATELY or
				FF_NOTATALL, or you'll change the way imagemaps save.
