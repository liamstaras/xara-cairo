>	class OptionsChangingMessage : public Msg

	Author:		Neville_Humphrys (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	3/1/1995
	Purpose:	This message is sent when a user has changed the options on a document or
				a global application based option. At present the messages include:-

				NEWUNITS messages are broadcast when the user has specified new display, page
				or font units are to be used.

				An OptionsChangingMsg contains a pointer to the appropriate Document
				object (pScopeDoc), and a state indicating the option that is being changed.
				Both members are public.
	
	SeeAlso:	OptionsTabs; UnitsTab; AppPrefsDlg; DocPrefsDlg;
