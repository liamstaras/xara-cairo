>	class InternalClipboardType : public CC_CLASS_MEMDUMP

	Author:		Jason_Williams (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	26/4/95
	
	Purpose:	This class is a very simple class which describes an internal clipboard
				data format. Each ClipboardMapping uses one of these to describe the type
				of input data they require in order to export, and thes export mappings
				will only be available to the clipboard if at least one node in the
				InternalClipboard supports output in this internal format.
				
				These formats are (currently):
					CLIPTYPE_VECTOR, CLIPTYPE_TEXT, CLIPTYPE_BITMAP.

				VECTOR includes all nodes, and is always assumed to be exportable.
				i.e. it's an "I can always export" thing.

				TEXT includes text characters only (text can be exported as paths or
				as unicode text). That is, an export mapping that supports Text can
				export text characters only, so will not be placed upon the clipboard
				unless there is some text somewhere on the clipboard.

				BITMAP is used for exporting bitmap fills as simple bitmaps. i.e. If no
				bitmap fills are on the clipboard, Bitmap mappings will not be available.
