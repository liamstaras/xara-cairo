>	class NodeRect : public NodeSimpleShape

	Author:		Mario_Shamtani (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>, Changed by Rik
	Created:	22/9/93
	Purpose:	A Node rect represents a rectangle object in the tree. It is derived from
				NodeSimple Shape that contains most of the functionality it needs. Simple
				Shapes are a group of nodes that are based around a parallelogram. The shape
				is fitted into a parallelogram so that it can be transformed while keeping
				its own identity (ie, it does not have to be turned into a NodePath)
