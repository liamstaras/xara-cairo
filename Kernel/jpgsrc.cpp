>	boolean JPEGDataSource::FillInputBuffer (j_decompress_ptr cinfo)

	Author:		Colin_Barfoot (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	08/08/96
	Inputs:		cinfo : a pointer to a j_decompress_ptr provided by the IJG routines
	Purpose:	Overrides the standard implementation using stdio with a CCFile version.

	Notes:		The following extract from the IJG library explains its purpose:

				Fill the input buffer --- called whenever buffer is emptied.

				In typical applications, this should read fresh data into the buffer
				(ignoring the current state of next_input_byte & bytes_in_buffer),
				reset the pointer & count to the start of the buffer, and return TRUE
				indicating that the buffer has been reloaded.  It is not necessary to
				fill the buffer entirely, only to obtain at least one more byte.

				There is no such thing as an EOF return.  If the end of the file has been
				reached, the routine has a choice of ERREXIT() or inserting fake data into
				the buffer.  In most cases, generating a warning message and inserting a
				fake EOI marker is the best course of action --- this will allow the
				decompressor to output however much of the image is there.  However,
				the resulting error message is misleading if the real problem is an empty
				input file, so we handle that case specially.

				In applications that need to be able to suspend compression due to input
				not being available yet, a FALSE return indicates that no more data can be
				obtained right now, but more may be forthcoming later.  In this situation,
				the decompressor will return to its caller (with an indication of the
				number of scanlines it has read, if any).  The application should resume
				decompression after it has loaded more data into the input buffer.  Note
				that there are substantial restrictions on the use of suspension --- see
				the documentation.

				When suspending, the decompressor will back up to a convenient restart point
				(typically the start of the current MCU). next_input_byte & bytes_in_buffer
				indicate where the restart point will be if the current call returns FALSE.
				Data beyond this point must be rescanned after resumption, so move it to
				the front of the buffer rather than discarding it.
