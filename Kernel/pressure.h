	Author;		Jason
	Created:	30/1/97

	Purpose:	Given a bunch of pressure samples (from a graphics tablet, or simulated
				from mouse movements) this class provides methods to produce a ValueFunction
				object representing the variable-pressure information. The pressure
				information is smoothed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be saved,
				and to improve the quality of the pressure information (e.g. to get smooth
				pressure-pen strokes)
