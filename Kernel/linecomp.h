/* NOTES:
This superclass was created so that both the old vector stroking system and the new brush system
could be stored and retrieved in an identical manner.  Unfortunately the StrokeComponent class
was written making extensive use of friend classes calling static functions, this did not lend 
itself particularly well to inheritance so what we currently have is a load of functions in the 
LineComponent class which are ripped from StrokeComponent, however the Brush component is the only
one that makes use of them as all the stroke code is in place with these static functions.
If I have time to rework the stroke component code then I will try to sort this out. */

				LineComponents share a global cache of available Line types.
				Individual instances serve as managers for the list, mainly providing
