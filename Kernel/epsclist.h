>	class EPSCommentList : public CCObject

	Author:		Graeme_Sutherland (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	28/4/00
	Purpose:	Wraps up the EPSCommentDef structs into a list class. This will allow me to
				have a changeable list for different versions of the file, and as a result
				the whole importing of comments much less restrictive, but at the penalty of
				a speed hit. Looking up a token will be on O(n) operation, rather than the
				much quicker array look-up that currently exists.
	SeeAlso:	EPSFilter
