	Author:		Rik_Heywood (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	17/10/94
	Purpose:	Acts as a base class for all Dialogs that want to render using render regions
				in them.

	Notes:		This functionality has been moved into DialogOp so that it may be shared
				by DialogBarOps. Thus, you can just derive directly from DialogOp. This
				class may cease to exist soon.
