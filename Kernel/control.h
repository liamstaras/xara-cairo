	Created:	24/10/2000

	Purpose:	Shadow, bevel and contour controllers are finally getting a base class,
				in which common code can now live. These nodes are distinct from other
				group nodes, in that:
				
					i)	the user is (just about) completely unaware of them - objects
						'grouped' within them don't appear to be grouped together.

					ii) when the user edits one node within the controller, eg they resize
						a shadowed circle, the other node often needs to know of the change,
						eg the shadow needs to regenerate. This behaviour does not apply to
						normal groups.
