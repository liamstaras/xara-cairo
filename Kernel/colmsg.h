	Author:		Jason_Williams (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	11/5/94
	Purpose:	This message is sent whenever certain events of importance happen in the
				colour system. Most of these events relate to IndexedColour lists, or
				individual IndexedColours.
				See Develop:Camelot\Docs\howtouse\message.doc for details.

	SeeAlso:	ColourManager

		LISTUPDATED,	  				// Sent when the existing list is edited
		COLOURUPDATED,					// Sent when a colour has changed (visibly - see below)
		COLOURUPDATEDINVISIBLE,			// Sent when a colour has changed (invisibly - see below)
		LISTDESELECTED,		   			// Sent when there is now no selected list
		LISTDELETED,					// Sent when a list has been deleted

		NEWLISTBORN,					// Sent when a new list is created, so that
										// others can add sort modes to it.

		SELVIEWCONTEXTCHANGE			// Sent when the colour context attached to the
										// selected view changes (so the col editor, gallery,
										// line can redraw using new colour correction info)

	ColourList *NewColourList;  		// NULL, or points to the new/affected ColourList
	IndexedColour *ChangedColour;		// NULL, or pointer to the colour which has changed
	ColourState State;					// The state, as defined above

// **** SPECIAL NOTE ****
// COLOURUPDATED and COLOURUPDATEDINVISIBLE are used in the following fashion:
// If the definition of the colour chnages such that the actual dispalyed colour will change,
// thus necessitating a redraw of the document, a COLOURUPDATED should be sent.
// If part of the definition changes which will not need a redraw of coloured regions (e.g
// the name, type, etc), then a COLOURUPDATEDINVISIBLE is sent. The latter is only used
// by those entities which need to update on all colour changes (they sit on both messages)
// while things like document redraws only occur if the visible colour has chnaged.
// See ColourManager::ColourHasChanged and ColourHasChangedInvisible
