	Author:		Karim_MacDonald (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	21/11/2000
	Inputs:		
	Outputs:	
	Returns:	
	Purpose:	ContourBecomeA2 class provides a greener alternative to ContourBecomeA.

				Reasons to use us:
				It deals with all lines correctly, because it doesn't simulate line width by
				contouring out from lines (like ContourBecomeA), but actually strokes them,
				and contours outwards from the result.

				Reasons not to use us:
				1.	We don't currently deal with brush strokes correctly.
				2.	We currently only do rounded contours - no bevelled or mitred contours.

				Example usage:
					Path ContourPath;
					ContourPath.Initialise();
					ContourBecomeA2 baContour(NULL, MillipointWidth, &ContourPath)
					BOOL Success = pSourceNode->DoBecomeA(&baContour);

					( source node not included :o] )
