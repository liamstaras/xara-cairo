/********************************************************************************************
>	class DragTool : public Tool_v1

	Author:		Karim_MacDonald (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	13/10/1999
	Purpose:	The Drag tool is a base class for the Selector and Slice tools.
				It acts to give these tools a common heritage, so that TransOperation,
				which handles dragging of objects, can maintain a pointer to them and inform
				them of various events during a drag. At some point in the future (ie maybe
				never, but we can hope...) it may be useful to pull common drag functionality
				up from these two tools, into a base implementation in this class.

				Currently, all the function definitions in this class are purely to allow
				TransOperation's pSelTool data member to be  changed from a SelectorTool*
				to a DragTool*. Default implementation in this class is simply to do nothing.

				CGS:

				The DragTool is also the base class for all tools which require selection
				ability.  A single interface is provided for this pupose:  OnClick ().
				OnClick () actually serves as a wrapper for our selection tool - thereby
				allowing all derived tools to harness the power of our selection tool.
