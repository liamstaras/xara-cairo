>	void EnsureFailedLine(LPCSTR AssertDescription, LPCSTR lpszFileName, int nLine)

	Author:		Simon M
	Created:	3/5/93
	Inputs:		AssertDescription: Reason for failure description  
				lpszFileName:      Filename of file that caused failure
				nLine:             Line number that caused failure
	Outputs:	-
	Returns:	-     
	Purpose:    This function should only ever be invoked from the ENSURE macro 
				which is similar to the ASSERT macro, the only difference being that 
				it takes a parameter which describes the reason for the failure. 
	Errors:		-
	SeeAlso:	-

/* Technical notes: 

This function is an almost direct copy of the AfxAssertFailedLine function which is
called from the ASSERT macro.
